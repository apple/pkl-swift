= Integration with Swift

Pkl provides a rich integration with Swift. Our integration allows you to embed the Pkl runtime into your Swift program, and also provides code generation from Pkl source code.

To get started, reference the xref:quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide].

        let config = try await MyConfig.loadFrom(source: .path("config.pkl"))
