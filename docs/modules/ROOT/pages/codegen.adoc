= Code generation

Pkl code may turn into Swift code by way of code generation.

== Running code generation

Code generation is done through the `pkl-gen-swift` binary. For installation instructions, consult the xref:ROOT:quickstart.adoc#codegen[codegen] section of the quickstart.

Once installed, Swift may be generated from Pkl:

[source,bash]
----
pkl-gen-swift pkl/AppConfig.pkl -o Sources/MyProject/Generated/
----

== How Pkl is turned into Swift

=== Basic types

The below table describes how Pkl types are mapped into Swift types.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Pkl type | Swift type
|`Boolean`
|`Bool`

|`String`
|`String`

|`Int`
|`Int`

|`Int8`
|`Int8`

|`Int16`
|`Int16`

|`Int32`
|`Int32`

|`UInt`
|`UInt`

|`UInt8`
|`UInt8`

|`UInt16`
|`UInt16`

|`UInt32`
|`UInt32`

|`Float`
|`Float64`

|`Number`
|`Float64`

|`List<T>`
|`[T]`

|`Listing<T>`
|`[T]`

|`Map<K, V>`
|`[K: V]`

|`Mapping<K, V>`
|`[K: V]`

|`Set<T>`
|`Set<T>`

|`Pair<A, B>`
|`PklSwift.Pair<A, B>`

|`Dynamic`
|Not supported

|`DataSize`
|`PklSwift.DataSize`

|`Duration`
|`PklSwift.Duration`

|`IntSeq`
|`PklSwift.IntSeq`

|`Regex`
|`PklSwift.PklRegex`

|`Class`
|Not supported

|`TypeAlias`
|Not supported

|`Any`
|`AnyHashable?`

|`unknown`
|`AnyHashable?`

|Unions (`A\|B\|C`)
|`AnyHashable?` footnote:[To represent unions as enums, they must be assigned to a typealias. For reference, see xref:enums[enums].]
|===

=== Classes

Classes turn into a variation of structs and protocols, depending on inheritance. Protocols get generated because Swift cannot model polymorphism with structs alone (e.g. a value that is a `Dog` struct is not assignable when an `Animal` struct is expected).

The below table describes how classes get generated.

|===
| Pkl class | Swift protocol | Swift struct
| `class Person`
| <none>
| `struct Person`

| `open class Person`
| `protocol Person`
| `struct PersonImpl: Person`

| `abstract class Person`
| `protocol Person`
| <none>

| `class Person extends Being`
| <none>
| `struct Person: Being` footnote:[all properties from `class Being` are added to this struct]
|===

NOTE: Classes with recursive property types will generate an invalid struct. This is a known limitation of Swift.

[[enums]]
=== Enums

If a typealias is defined as a union of types, it is turned into a Swift enum. Each alternative in the union becomes an enum member.

For example, the following Pkl code:

[source,pkl]
----
typealias City = "San Francisco"|"Cupertino"|"London"
----

Turns into something like this:

[source,swift]
----
enum City: String, CaseIterable, Decodable, Hashable {
    case sanFrancisco = "San Francisco"
    case cupertino = "Cupertino"
    case london = "London"
}
----

All other typealiases that aren't unions turn into Swift typealiases.

[[name-conflicts]]
== Resolving name conflicts

When turning Pkl names into Swift names, the code generator follows these rules:

1. Any non-letter and non-digit characters get stripped
2. Each preceding letter gets capitalized.

As a result, it is possible that two names collide and turn into the same Swift name.
To resolve these conflicts, the https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-swift/pkl.swift/current/swift/Name.html[`@swift.Name`]
annotation must be used on at least one of these declarations so the resulting names are distinct.

For example:

[source,pkl]
[subs="+attributes"]
----
import "package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-swift/pkl.swift@{pkl-swift-version}#/swift.pkl"

@swift.Name { value = "MyCoolApplication" }
class My_Application

class MyApplication
----
