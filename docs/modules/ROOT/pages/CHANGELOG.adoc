[[release-0.3.0]]
== 0.3.0 (2024-10-10)

=== Additions

* Add support for Pkl 0.26 features (https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/23[#23]).
* Add support for Windows (https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/24[#24]).

=== Changes

* Code generation change: `registeredIdentifier` is changed from `var` to `let` (https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/3[#3]).

=== Breaking Changes

* Remove support for custom `Pair`, because it is not meant to describe configuration data, and also can be better implemented as a tuple (https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/21[#21]).

=== Miscellaneous

* Documentation improvements (https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/10[#10], https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/12[#12], https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/16[#16]).
* Remove iOS from supported platforms in Package.swift (this was never supported) (https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/14[#14]).
* Code improvements (https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/pull/25[#25]).
