= Evaluator API

:uri-swift-coding-keys-docs: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types#2904057

pkl-swift provides a rich API for evaluating Pkl files in Swift via `PklSwift.Evaluator`. It can be configured with xref:custom-readers[custom readers], have its own security settings, control
external property inputs, and more.

Evaluation occurs by spawning the `pkl` cli as a child process, and communicates via message passing.

== Using evaluators

There are two methods for interacting with `PklSwift.Evaluator`:

1. `PklSwift.withEvaluator(options:_:)`
2. `PklSwift.EvaluatorManager.withEvaluator(options:_:)`

These two methods are distinguished by how they manage the lifecycle of the underlying `pkl` child process.
`PklSwift.withEvaluator(options:_:)` will spawn a child process per-evaluator, whereas `PklSwift.EvaluatorManager.withEvaluator(options:_:)` will spawn a
child process for the lifetime of the evaluator manager.

For most use cases, it is sufficient to use `PklSwift.withEvaluator(options:_:)`. If multiple evaluators are desired,
for example, to maintain separate caches or to have different settings, the evaluator manager should be used.

== Evaluating modules

=== With code generation

Swift structs generated from Pkl modules may be evaluated simply through the generated `loadFrom(source:)` and `loadFrom(evaluator:source:)` methods.

For example, a Pkl module can be evaluated into a generated struct like so:

[source,swift]
----
@main struct Main {
    static func main() async throws {
        let config = try await AppConfig.loadFrom(source: .path("myconfig.pkl"))
        print("Got config: \(config)")
    }
}
----

=== Without code generation

Pkl modules may be evaluated directly into Swift structs without using code generation.

For example, given the Pkl module:

.foo.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
foo: String = "hello"

bar: Int = 5
----

A Swift struct can be created matching the shape of the Pkl module.
The Swift module must be `Decodable`.

.foo.swift
[source,swift]
----
struct Foo: Decodable {
    let foo: String
    let bar: Int
}
----

Then, provide `Foo.self` to the `evaluateModule` method:

[source,swift]
----
let result = try await withEvaluator { evaluator in
    try await evaluator.evaluateModule(source: .path("foo.pkl"), as: Foo.self)
}
----

If the Swift property name doesn't match the Pkl name, create a nested `CodingKeys` enum that describes how Swift names turn into Pkl names.

For more details, consult the link:{uri-swift-coding-keys-docs}[Swift documentation].

[source,swift]
----
struct Foo: Decodable {
    let myFoo: String
    let myBar: Innt

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case myFoo = "foo"
        case myBar = "bar"
    }
}
----

== Alternative evaluation modes

=== Textual and multiple file output

In addition to modules, an evaluator may also evaluate a module's `output.text` and `output.files` properties. This mimics the behavior of the CLI.

Take this Pkl module:

.foo.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
foo = "foo"

bar = "bar"
----

The textual output of this module may be evaluated via `PklSwift.Evaluator.evaluateOutputText(source:)`.

.main.swift
[source,swift]
----
@main struct Main {
    static func main() async throws {
        let textOutput = try await withEvaluator { evaluator in
            try await evaluator.evaluateOutputText(source: .path("my/module.pkl"))
        }
        print(textOutput)
    }
}
----

=== Expressions

In addition to evaluating modules and textual/file output, _any_ arbitrary expression may be evaluated within a module.
In fact, the textual and file output of a module are implemented in terms of evaluating an expression.

.main.swift
[source,swift]
----
@main struct Main {
    static func main() async throws {
        let res = try await withEvaluator { evaluator in
            try await evaluator.evaluateExpression(
                source: .text("foo = 5"), // <1>
                expression: "foo + 10", // <2>
                as: Int.self // <3>
            )
        }
        print("foo is \(res)") // prints "foo is 15"
    }
}
----
<1> `.text("foo = 5")` causes Pkl to evaluate a synthetic module whose contents are `foo = 5`.
<2> The expression to be evaluated.
<3> The expression's result type.

== Evaluator options

An evaluator is configured via options on `PklSwift.EvaluatorOptions`.
A sensible default set of options is provided on `PklSwift.EvaluatorOptions.preconfigured`.
Alternatively, they can be built from empty by starting with `PklSwift.EvaluatorOptions.empty`.

[#custom-readers]
== Custom readers

It is possible to use a custom reader for resources and modules by implementing the `PklSwift.ResourceReader` and `PklSwift.ModuleReader` protocols.

Custom readers must identify the scheme that they are responsible for reading by setting the `scheme` field. For example,
a reader may be registered to resolve the Pkl expression `read("secret:FOO")` by registering `"secret"` as its scheme.

If a resource matches a scheme identified by a custom reader, its `read()` method will be called to retrieve the contents.
