/// - Returns: Whether or not the type named by `typeName` should be passed to

///   - nameFilter: If not `nullptr`, a filtering function that checks if a type
///     name is valid before realizing the type.
///   - body: A function to invoke. `context` is passed to it along with a
///     type metadata pointer (which can be bitcast to `Any.Type`.)
///   - context: An arbitrary pointer to pass to `body`.
///
/// This function may enumerate the same type more than once (for instance, if
